# sql
This repository contains my code in PostgreSQL of a course project on my MSc Data and Web Science, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
The database is about the mapping on USA. It contains the following entities and the relations between them are shown on the following ER Diagram.

As you can see, the ER was made with the help of Visual Paradigm, a really useful tool for diagram creation etc.
Then the physical model is generated.

Because the diagrams can't be seen well, the diagrams will also be uploaded here.
Then the database is loaded on PostgreSQL where the queries occur.
